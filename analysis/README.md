# Analysis

This folder contains the analysis files for the **A/B Testing with Lingua** project. The analyses focus on data simulation, EDA, Bayesian analysis, and the communication of important findings to non-technical stakeholders.

## File Descriptions

- **`ab_testing_lingua.html`**: A rendered HTML file of the Quarto document, viewable in any web browser. This is a static version of the analysis, including both code and output, for easy sharing.

## Reproducibility

1. Install R (version 4.3.3 or higher) and RStudio.
2. Install the necessary R packages listed in the `analysis.qmd` file.
3. Open the `.qmd` file in RStudio and execute the code.

### Viewing Only
